            Prithviraj Chauhan, also known as Rai Pithora, was a legendary Rajput king of the Chauhan dynasty who ruled
            from Ajmer and Delhi in the twelfth century CE. Renowned for his extraordinary valor and leadership, he
            unified many Rajput clans and bravely defended his kingdom against repeated invasions. His greatest legacy
            comes from the heroic battles of Tarain, where he fiercely resisted the advancing forces of Muhammad Ghori.
            Although he was eventually defeated in the Second Battle of Tarain in 1192, Prithviraj Chauhan remains
            celebrated in Indian history as a symbol of courage, patriotism, and unwavering spirit in the face of
            adversity.
